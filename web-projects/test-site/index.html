        <p>The way I did. When I was young, you might’ve said I was a “nice looking young lady”, but never beautiful. My body has not aged well. My family didn’t have the money for me to get braces, so my teeth are very crooked. I have a large nose and rosacea on my face that makes me look sunburned. I have a big, fleshy area under my chin, I’m obese, and to “top it off”, I’m 6′ 2″ tall.</p>
        <p>Here’s the “kicker”, I make friends absolutely everywhere I go and even the French were nice to me…ha ha! I smile at everyone and share compliments to strangers. I wear loud, crazy clothes, because honestly, muted clothes aren’t going to hide me. I have friends who’d die for me, have a handsome, loving husband and wonderful kids. I don’t try to be pretty as I don't use make-up and I cut my own hair. I’m huge, loud, funny, caring, trustworthy and smart. Pretty shmitty! Just be wonderful, be successful and be a good friend. Being “pretty” is just not that important!</p>
